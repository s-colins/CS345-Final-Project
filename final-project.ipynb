    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this project is from a posting from [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com) called [Predicting Credit Card Customer Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/predicting-credit-card-customer-attrition-with-m/data) which sources an upload to [zendoo.org](https://zenodo.org) by a user named *zhyli* under the *Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International* license.

    "This dataset contains many features that are both personal and financial, our usecase is to use personal features to make finanical classifications. Here are the personal features that are important to for our experiments, their data type and what they mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Attrition_Flag`: *boolean* - (`'Existing Customer'`/`'Attrited Customer'`) A boolean value representing if an entry is currently a customer or used to be a customer in the past.\n",
    "- `Customer_Age`: *integer* - The age of the customer in years.\n",
    "- `Gender`: *boolean* - (`M`/`F`) The gender of the customer.\n",
    "- `Dependant_Count`: *integer* - The number of dependants that the customer has (Ex. child, partner, elderly parent).\n",
    "- `Education_Level`: *categorical* - The highest education level that the customer has achieved which can include `'Uneducated'`, `'High School'`, `'College'`, `'Graduate'` or `'Unknown'`. \n",
    "- `Marital_Status`: *categorical* - The marital status of the customer which can include `'Single'`, `'Married'` or `'Unknown'` which is the reason this feature is not boolean.\n",
    "- `Income_Category`: *categorical* - The range of income that the customer falls into based upon their annual income which ranges from `'Less than $40k'`, `'$40k - $60k'`, `'$60k - $80k'`, `'$80k - $120k'`, or `'Unknown'`.\n",
    "- `Total_Relationship_Count`: *integer* - The number of relationships that the customer has with the credit card provider (Ex. Savings account, Checking account, Mortgage, Credit card accounts). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the financial feature that we are trying to make classifications about.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Credit_Limit`: *integer* - The total amount of money a customer is allowed to borrow on a credit card.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this features is an integer, we transform it into categorical data which is explained in the [Creating Variable Classifications](#Creating-Variable-Classifications) section of this notebook."

    "## Data Loading and Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do anything, we need to load the credit card customer data properly. The `load_credit_card_customer_data` checks to see if the data file `BankChurners.csv` has already been downloaded and if not, it downloads it from `zenodo.org`. Initially we had this function return an `X, y` but it returns a `pandas` dataframe. This is because it's easier to index a `pandas` with the columns that we want to select, this functionality is present in `select_features`. We then select personal features that we want to use as information to predict a financial feature."

    "The last data formatting step we need to perform is the categorizaion of the `'Credit_Limit'`. For a binary classification, we will classify a customer based on if their credit limit is higher than the median or lower than the median. Later on, we will create more categories in order to compare the accuracy of a model based upon the number of different classifications it can make. We can take variable $g$ which represents the number of different classifications. When $g = 2$ we are classifying if a customer has a credit limit higher than the median, or a credit limit lower than the median. When $g = 3$ we are classifying if a customer is in the bottom 33rd percentile, in the middle 33rd percentile, or in the top 33rd percentile in terms of credit limit. This is part of our experimentation as this is an idea we had in order to measure the accuracy of models based the number of classification they could make."

    "To interpret the graph above, one third of the total amount of entries fall below the first division ($\\lt 2963.00$) another third fall between the two divisions ($\\ge 2963.00$ and $\\lt 8082.67$) and the last third fall above the second division ($\\ge 8082.67$).

    "Here you can see that we are creating classifications based on dividing the credit limit range into equal thirds. The question we are going to ask later on is, \"*Does some model perform better on data labeled with an equal **amount of entries** in each classification, or does it perform better on data labeled with an equal **range of labels**?*\" (`divide_percentile` or `divide_range`).\n",

    "For now we are going to use the binary classification using `divide_percentile(2, y)` in order to classify entries if they are higher or lower than the median, but later on we will discuss the performance of models based upon which method we are using to label the data."
